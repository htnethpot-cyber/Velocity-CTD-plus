/**
 * An asynchronous, non-reentrant lock keyed by the (uuid, name) tuple of a player.
 *
 * <p>A lock is considered held for a given (uuid, name) pair if either {@code uuid} is currently
 * locked, OR {@code name} is currently locked. This means an attempt to register a player whose
 * uuid matches one already in flight, or whose name matches one already in flight, must wait.
 *
 * <p>The lock is non-blocking: {@link #acquire(UUID, String)} returns a {@link CompletableFuture}
 * that completes when the lock is granted. Waiters are stored in a FIFO queue, but the lock is
 * not strictly FIFO across all identities: a later waiter whose required (uuid, name) pair is
 * free may be granted ahead of an earlier waiter who is still blocked. Per-identity ordering is
 * preserved (two waiters for the same identity are granted in FIFO order). A waiter that cancels
 * its future hands the lock straight on to the next one when its turn comes.
